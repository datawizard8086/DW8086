## Audience Profile

Below are the details regarding the Organization, Client's information and other details of the Organization on which our study analysis depends.

### Organization Details

Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of the National Park Service. In 1966, the National Monument first began as a part of the National Register of Historic Places. The National Monument is 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. Under the Homestead Act, the site is one of the most successful lands claimed sites. HOME allows qualified volunteers to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation, and improvement of the property. As a result, more than 270 million acres of land were given to the volunteers. This led to drastic changes in the quality of land which was much needed. The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking a tour of the interactive museum of the American homesteading. The Homestead Act holds significance for the westward expansion of the United States. It allows any volunteer to claim the land in exchange for taking care of it, keeping it free from contamination, and persuading people to take the best care of the land they live in. The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and the lives of the people by preserving our resources for future generations.

### Client's Information

Jesse Bolli, a Resource Management Specialist at Homestead National Monument is the main stakeholder for this project. He provided multiple spreadsheets which documented the water quality observations from 2002 to 2017. These spreadsheets are the backbone of this project and he is our main contact for questions. He also provided us some extra information which include weather temperature, the precipitation, and more. This extra information will make it easier to perform data cleaning.

### Sociodemographic

#### Training & Education
In 1972, the U.S. government introduced the Clean Water Act (CWA) to conserve the quality of surface water. This act was introduced to make sure that all sources of surface water like lakes, streams, and rivers are regulated. From this point onward, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the water quality standards and requirements. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, “the CWA made it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained”. For instance, the EPA set the threshold for the acceptable amount of pollutants and wastewater standards for the industry.

Acknowledge the importance of water quality, many park rangers and water quality professionals have been monitoring the quality of surface water throughout the country. By monitoring water quality, the researchers can identify specific contaminations, trends, and whether the water meets EPA standards. To identify contaminations, the researchers need to look at various chemical constituents like phosphorus, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen. Some of the common factors that lead to water pollution are “the number of people living in a watershed, how the land is used (agriculture, forested, urbanized, etc.) and the everyday behavior of the population”. Also, the researchers need to look at some other components like the streamflow, temperature, pH level, turbidity, total solids, conductivity, total alkalinity, and Fecal bacteria. The combinations of all these measurements help pinpoint the source of the contamination. For instance, if the source of the contamination is from industrial discharge, the researchers can expect to have unusual measurements on the temperature, the conductivity, the total solids, the toxics, and the pH level. In general, the water temperature from upstream to downstream shouldn’t change too drastically so it would be a good signal to let the researchers know that the water might be contaminated.

#### Technical skills
To measure temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO), the best method is to consistently take measurements in the same spot at the exact time daily. For DO, there are some factors that would have an impact on the measurements like temperature, salinity, and elevation. The unit for DO is milligrams per liter (mg/L).  

For conventional variables test, the researchers need to look at the pH level, dissolved solids, and conductivity. With pH level, the goal is to look at the acidic and alkalinity of the water. The neutral pH level for surface water is between 6.0 to 8.5. The pH level can be affected by the types of minerals and soils the water passes through. Some of the dissolved solids that the researchers need to look at are sodium, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and chloride. The normal dissolved solids level for fresh water range from 0 to 1000 mg/L. In addition, the dissolved solid measurements can be used to identify the conductivity of the water by looking at inorganic solids. The water stream will have a low conductivity if it is contaminated with oil or phenol. The unit for conductivity is micro siemens per centimeter (µS/cm).  

Turbidity is another measurement of water quality which focusing on the clarity of the water stream. By looking at the material suspended in water like soil particles (clay, silt, and sand), algae, plankton, microbes, and other substances, the researchers can monitor the amount of light that goes through the water hence recognize the water turbidity.


### Goals

#### Requirements
  * To monitor the water quality between two sites of cub creek which is over 1 mile apart.
  * To Analyze different parameters i.e. dissolved oxygen, flow, pH, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, E.coli, etc.
  * To analyze the differences between the west sites where the water enters and the north site where the water exists.
  * To maintain and protect the nearby land and keep it healthy for cultivation and take measures from being contaminated.
  
#### Organization Values/Mission
The goal of the Homestead Act is to provide free land for volunteers in exchange for their residence, cultivation, and improvement of the land. This agenda helps maximized the use of natural lands and resources. Volunteers received land for free to live in and at the same time the natural resources, the land, and the water habitats were protected from many contaminations. Furthermore, volunteers received more than 10 percent of the land in the US to achieve the ultimate Homestead goal and fulfill their American dreams. The goal is to achieve a diverse settlement, agricultural benefits and huge advancement in the field of agriculture. Building nature, renewing our resources to the best for mankind and for future generations to live in.
To address concerns about water quality for the sites in Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), the team started monitoring the quality of water against various factors. Most quality measurements met state standards and were found to be generally consistent and typical for the streams belonging to the region. However, there were some measurements that exceeded the acceptance level. The main goal of this was to monitor the water quality and deduce what factors are affecting the water quality of the targeted site. Also, the measures that could be undertaken to address the problems affecting the quality of the streams of the targeted sites.

#### Expectations
Predicting and controlling amount of wastewater discharge and industrial chemical discharge. Using the available data and applying data analytics, designing a model which can help predicting the waste. 

### Communities (served by organization)

Homestead monitors couple of parameters such as 	
* Air
* Water
* Wild Life
* Fire Ecology
* Land Cover

All the monitoring reports are available and are open to the public. This group’s main goal is to monitor those factors mentioned above and publish them and make it available to the public. The reports available online most of them are visible to the public, and they do mention the visibility in all the reports.

Based on their reports following are the list of communities which are benefited by their mission:

* Aquatic Society
* Immigrants who come to the U.S.A for fulfilling their dream
* Communities which are looking for any livelihood 
* Natural Resources which are in the fear of contamination, the authorities do read the reports and decide which lands need to be protected from being contaminated
* The reports are also available to various government agencies who act based on their reports



### Challenges
The main challenges in cub creek water are to control the wastewater discharge and the industrial chemical discharges.  Flood water also negatively impacting the integrity of the cub creek water. Any biological or chemical changes impact directly to the human health and ecosystem.
