    <h1> Background</h1>
    <p>
        Homestead Act has been one of the most important legislation in the United States. The very first Homestead was claimed in Brownville, Nebraska by a resident of Ohio name Daniel Freeman in the year 1863. He is the first homesteader in the nation. Daniel served more than 1000 acres and became one of the prominent residents of Gage County. He proposed the idea of memorizing the place he lived in, on his name. Soon after his death, the residents of Beatrice started the agenda of preserving his homestead as National park. Initially, the proposal got rejected by the officials but in the year 1934, the resident of Beatrice organized National Homestead Park Association to continue the deed as performed by The Daniel. [1]

        The Association could not do much due to funds issue and soon after America entered World War II the park visitation and development was suspended. [1]

        However, in the year 1950, the national park service (NPS) acquired the park and built the visitor center. Gradually there was some positive progress towards the development and in the year 1981, the National Monument had five permanent employees, one part-time and a few seasonal employees. [1]

        In the 1970s and 1980s seasonal rangers demonstrated the history of the Homestead Act. By the early 1990s, the Homestead Act began to move to other states in the country. [1]

    <h1>Audience Targets </h1>
    <p>
        Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of the National Park Service. In 1966, the National Monument first began as a part of the National Register of Historic Places.
        The National Monument is 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. Under the Homestead Act, the site is one of the most successful lands claimed sites.
        HOME allows qualified volunteers to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation, and improvement of the property.
        As a result, more than 270 million acres of land were given to the volunteers. This led to drastic changes in the quality of land which was much needed. The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking a tour of the interactive museum of the American homesteading.
        The Homestead Act holds significance for the westward expansion of the United States. It allows any volunteer to claim the land in exchange for taking care of it, keeping it free from contamination, and persuading people to take the best care of the land they live in.
        The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and the lives of the people by preserving our resources for future generations.

<h1> Analysis </h1>
<p>
    A simple linear regression was applied to predict a continuous outcome variable (y)  which pH value of water in this case based on one single predictor variable (x) which is level of Dissolved Oxygen in water in this case for North Site.
</p>
<p>   The outcome of linear regression model was plotted using ggplot which provides us with the above mentioned plot.
</p>
<p>
   <h2> The conclusions so drawn from ggplots are:- </h2>



    1.Residual Vs Fitted: Used to check the linear relationship assumptions. A horizontal line, without distinct patterns is an indication for a linear relationship, which is good. In this case there is almost no pattern in the residual plot. This suggests that we cannot assume linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome variables.

&nbsp;

    2. Normal Q-Q: Used to examine whether the residuals are normally distributed. It’s good if residuals points follow the straight dashed line. In this case many observations are far away from the expected line therefore not normally distributed.

&nbsp;

    3. Standardized Residual Plot: The plot shows if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors. It’s good if we see a horizontal line with equally spread points. In this case, this is not the case. It can be seen that the variability (variances) of the residual points is haphazard
with the value of the fitted outcome variable, suggesting no non-constant variances in the residuals errors.



4. Residue Vs Leverage: Used to identify influential cases, that is extreme values that might influence the regression results when included or excluded from the analysis. In this case the two observations 186 and 188 show high leverage point and should be well investigated.
